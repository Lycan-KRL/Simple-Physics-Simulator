# Simple-Physics-Simulator
  Alright! I got something working to demonstrate a rigid body simulator utilizing a trignometric system.    
  
  The bodies I used were the CircleShapes of SFML to simplify a few ideas concerning collisions and boundary checking.  
  
  There are a few neat things I've implemented to create an amusing experience showing objects fly around, including the option to add more circles and being able to pick up an object and throw it.  
  
  Make sure to have SFML installed to be able to run this program.  
  
# Available Commands
- 'N' adds a new object
- 'Q' is a shortcut to terminate the program
- Left-Click and hold onto a circle to be able to pick it up

# Tools Used  
- Mingw32 Terminal  
- SFML  
- VSCode
